POF+ PartyOrganizer is a WordPress plugin designed for demoscene event organizers to sell and manage tickets online, manage votes and more.

== Description ==
POF+ PartyOrganizer By Feryx is a WordPress plugin designed for all demoscene event organizers to sell and manage tickets online, manage votes and more.  
It’s similar in purpose to tools like PartyMaister or Wuhu, but includes online ticket sales and some extra features I felt were missing in those platforms.

This software is intended for **demoscene events, parties, educational purposes, and other non-commercial uses**.

== Installation ==

2. If you want to sell tickets and merchandise online, install WooCommerce (tested with v10.x) and configure it.
3. After WooCommerce is installed, enable the **POF+ Ticket** plugin to sell and manage tickets.
4. Install the POF plugin if you haven’t already.

== About the Ticket System ==
The Party Organizer plugin provides PDF ticket generation and validation features.  
It is built on top of widely used open-source libraries:
